        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 white onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken (250 g), cooked, shredded</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika, or cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>4 oz cream cheese (110 g)</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk (470 mL)</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth (60 mL)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (250 g)</li>
        <li>2 cups panko breadcrumbs (100 g)</li>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot, heat olive oil, then sauté garlic and onions until soft and brown. Add shredded chicken, salt, and paprika (or cayenne pepper). Stir to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture into a bowl, add cream cheese and parsley. Mix well.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add butter, chicken broth, and milk. Bring to a boil. Stir in flour until dough is formed.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a flat surface. Knead the dough while it is warm, but not hot.</li>
        <li>Pinch a piece of dough, about the size of a large egg, and roll into a ball. Using your hands, flatten the dough and spoon filling into the center. Wrap the dough into a pear shape and make sure there aren’t any holes.</li>
        <li>While heating a pot of oil to 350˚F/180˚C, dredge the dough in egg and panko, then deep-fry till golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Drain on a towel, or wire rack and serve immediately.</li>
